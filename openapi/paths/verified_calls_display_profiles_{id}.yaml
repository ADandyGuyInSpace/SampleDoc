    Update an existing Verified Calls Display Profile and allows adding/removing
    nested Call Reasons and Phone Numbers. Different attributes can be updated
    depending on the Verified Calls Display Profile's status: For the
    VERIFICATION_STATE_PENDING status, no fields can be updated. For the
    VERIFICATION_STATE_VERIFIED status, it is allowed only to add/remove Call
    Reaons and Phone Numbers. For the other statuses, all fields can be updated.
    All existing Call Reasons and Phone Numbers must be sent during the request,
    or the update will fail.
