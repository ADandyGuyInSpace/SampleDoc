    This API disables a SIM card, disconnecting it from the network and making
    it impossible to consume data.<br/>

    The API will trigger an asynchronous operation called a SIM Card Action.
    Transitioning to the disabled state may take a period of time. The status of
    the SIM Card Action can be followed through the [List SIM Card
    Action](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/api/v2/wireless/SIM-Card-Actions#ListSIMCardActions)
    API.
