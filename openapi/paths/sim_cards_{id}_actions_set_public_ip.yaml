    This API makes a SIM card reachable on the public internet by mapping a
    random public IP to the SIM card. <br/><br/>
     The API will trigger an asynchronous operation called a SIM Card Action. The status of the SIM Card Action can be followed through the [List SIM Card Action](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/api/v2/wireless/SIM-Card-Actions#ListSIMCardActions) API. <br/><br/>
     Setting a Public IP to a SIM Card incurs a charge and will only succeed if the account has sufficient funds.
