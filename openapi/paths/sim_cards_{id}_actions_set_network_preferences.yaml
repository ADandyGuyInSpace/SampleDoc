    This API sets network preferences for a SIM card.<br/>

    Every SIM card has default network preferences defined on Telnyx. These
    preferences will determine how a SIMCard will connect to the network by
    considering a list of preferable operators.<br/><br/>

    The SIM card needs to be attached to the network so this can connect and SMS
    must be available, otherwise, the operation will fail. This preference will
    only be respected if the network is available, otherwise the strongest
    signal will be used. <br/><br/>

    The API will trigger an asynchronous operation called a SIM Card Action.
    Creating network preferences may take a period of time. The status of the
    SIM Card Action can be followed through the [List SIM Card
    Action](https://developersdev.telnyx.com/docs/api/v2/wireless/SIM-Card-Actions#ListSIMCardActions)
    API.
