    This API allows dispatching the same operation described for the PUT
    sim_cards/:sim_card_id/network_preferences API for multiple SIM cards at
    once.<br/><br/>

    Although, a SIM card network preference may fail individually under any
    validation triggered as a consequence of its state. For example, a SIM can't
    have an in-progress OTA update for applying a Network Preference, so they'll
    fail when requested in this API. In that scenario, the specific error will
    be present in the response along with the successful definitions in the
    "errors" response node.
