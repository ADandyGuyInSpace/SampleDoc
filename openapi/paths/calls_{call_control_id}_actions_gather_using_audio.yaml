    You can pass a list of valid digits along with an 'invalid_audio_url', which
    will be played back at the beginning of each prompt. Playback will be
    interrupted when a DTMF signal is received. The
    [Answer](/docs/api/v2/call-control/Call-Commands#CallControlAnswer) command
    must be issued before the `gather_using_audio` command.


    **Expected Webhooks:**


    - `call.playback.started`

    - `call.playback.ended`

    - `call.dtmf.received` (you may receive many of these webhooks)

    - `call.gather.ended`
