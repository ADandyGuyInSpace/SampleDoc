    The SIM card will be able to connect to the network once the process to set
    it to standby has been completed, thus making it possible to consume
    data.<br/>

    To set a SIM card to standby, it must be associated with SIM card
    group.<br/>

    The API will trigger an asynchronous operation called a SIM Card Action.
    Transitioning to the standby state may take a period of time. The status of
    the SIM Card Action can be followed through the [List SIM Card
    Action](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/api/v2/wireless/SIM-Card-Actions#ListSIMCardActions)
    API.
