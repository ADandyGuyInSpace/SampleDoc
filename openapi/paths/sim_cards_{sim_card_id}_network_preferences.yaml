    <br/><br/>

    Every SIM card has default network preferences defined on Telnyx. These
    preferences will determine how a SIMCard will connect to the network by
    considering a list of preferable operators.<br/><br/>

    There can be multiple scenarios where an operator can be preferred over
    another, for example, when a specific mobile operator can provide better
    network latency or better pricing.
