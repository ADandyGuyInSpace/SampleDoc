    Telnyx has a set of GSM mobile operators partners that are available through
    our mobile network roaming. This resource is entirely managed by Telnyx and
    may change over time. That means that this resource won't allow any write
    operations for it. Still, it's available so it can be used as a support
    resource that can be related to other resources or become a configuration
    option.
