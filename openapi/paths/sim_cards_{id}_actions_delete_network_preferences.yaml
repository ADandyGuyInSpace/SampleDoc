    The API will trigger an asynchronous operation called a SIM Card Action.
    Creating network preferences may take a period of time. The status of the
    SIM Card Action can be followed through the [List SIM Card
    Action](https://developersdev.telnyx.com/docs/api/v2/wireless/SIM-Card-Actions#ListSIMCardActions)
    API.
