    This action will asynchronously assign a provisioned Private Wireless
    Gateway to the SIM card group. Completing this operation defines that all
    SIM cards in the SIM card group will get their traffic controlled by the
    associated Private Wireless Gateway. This operation will also imply that new
    SIM cards assigned to a group will inherit its network definitions. If it's
    moved to a different group that doesn't have a Private Wireless Gateway,
    it'll use Telnyx's default mobile network configuration.
