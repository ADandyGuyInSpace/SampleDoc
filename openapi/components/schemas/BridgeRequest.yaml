      Use this field to avoid duplicate commands. Telnyx will ignore any command
      with the same `command_id` for the same `call_control_id`.

    type: string
  park_after_unbridge:
    description: >-
      Specifies behavior after the bridge ends (i.e. the opposite leg either
      hangs up or is transferred). If supplied with the value `self`, the
      current leg will be parked after unbridge. If not set, the default
      behavior is to hang up the leg.

    type: string
  queue:
    description: >-
      The name of the queue you want to bridge with, can't be used together with
      call_control_id parameter. Bridging with a queue means bridging with the
      first call in the queue. The call will always be removed from the queue
      regardless of whether bridging succeeds. Returns an error when the queue
      is empty.
