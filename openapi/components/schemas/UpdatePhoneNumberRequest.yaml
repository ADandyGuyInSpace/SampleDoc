      If someone attempts to port your phone number away from Telnyx and your
      phone number has an external PIN set, we will attempt to verify that you
      provided the correct external PIN to the winning carrier. Note that not

  number_level_routing:

      Specifies whether the number can have overrides to the routing settings on
      itself (enabled) or if it uses the associated connection for all routing
      settings (disabled). Defaults to enabled but will be changed to disabled
      in the future. There are performance advantages to using disabled and
      setting all routing information at the connection level.
