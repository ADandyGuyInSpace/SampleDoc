      created, that will be used as the managed accounts's organization's name.

    type: string

      account.

    type: string
  managed_account_allow_custom_pricing:
    description: >-
      Boolean value that indicates if the managed account is able to have custom
      pricing set for it or not. If false, uses the pricing of the manager
      account. Defaults to false. This value may be changed after creation, but
      there may be time lag between when the value is changed and pricing
      changes take effect.
    example: false
    type: boolean
  password:
    description: >-
      Password for the managed account. If a password is not supplied, the
      account will not be able to be signed into directly. (A password reset may
      still be performed later to enable sign-in via password.)
    example: 3jVjLq!tMuWKyWx4NN*CvhnB
    type: string
  rollup_billing:
    description: >-
      Boolean value that indicates if the billing information and charges to the
      managed account "roll up" to the manager account. If true, the managed
      account will not have its own balance and will use the shared balance with
      the manager account. This value cannot be changed after account creation
      without going through Telnyx support as changes require manual updates to
      the account ledger. Defaults to false.
