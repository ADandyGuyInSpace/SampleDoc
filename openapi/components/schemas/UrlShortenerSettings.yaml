  The URL shortener feature allows automatic replacement of URLs that were
  generated using

  a public URL shortener service. Some examples include bit.do, bit.ly, goo.gl,
  ht.ly,

  is.gd, ow.ly, rebrand.ly, t.co, tiny.cc, and tinyurl.com. Such URLs are
  replaced with

  with links generated by Telnyx. The use of custom links can improve branding
  and message

  deliverability.


  To disable this feature, set the object field to `null`.
