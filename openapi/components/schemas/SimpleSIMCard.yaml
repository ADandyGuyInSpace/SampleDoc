      The ICCID is the identifier of the specific SIM card/chip. Each SIM is

      SIM cards are identified on their individual operator networks by a unique
      International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI). <br/>

      Mobile network operators connect mobile phone calls and communicate with
      their market SIM cards using their IMSIs. The IMSI is stored in the
      Subscriber  Identity Module (SIM) inside the device and is sent by the
      device to the appropriate network. It is used to acquire the details of
      the device in the Home  Location Register (HLR) or the Visitor Location
      Register (VLR).
