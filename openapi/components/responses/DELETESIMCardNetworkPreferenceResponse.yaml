  A successful network preferences deletion response. <br/><br/>

  The delete won't be done right away - this is an asynchronous operation. The
  request will return the resource with an in-progress OTA update resource (in
  the ota_updates node) representing the delete operation. Similarly to the PUT
  API, the resource will only be deleted when the OTA updated is successfully
  completed.
